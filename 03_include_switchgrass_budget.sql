-- calculate the area that is at break even, averaged over 2011-2014:

-- select sum(clumuha) from clumu_cgsb_profit_2011_2014_mean where mean_profit_ha <= 0;

--  Next, include switchgrass budget into those areas.
-- cash rents need to be re-calculated to account for different cash rents of subfield area that is in switchgrass and that remains in row crops.

-- when I have clumu cash rents:

-- calculate mean cash rents 2011 - 2014
-- join clumu cash rents with table clumu_cgsb_profit_2011_2014_mean via cluid and mukey or cluid_mukey
-- create new column with swg price assumptions
